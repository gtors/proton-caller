[FAQ](https://github.com/caverym/Proton-Caller/wiki/FAQ)

## Problem Reporting:
Please create an issue on the [Github](https://github.com/caverym/Proton-Caller) page which lists: system, kernel version, game, shell, and if it is or isn't a Steam game â€“ provide how you had installed it and where it is installed. Additionally provide screenshots of the shell. Try many methods to get it to work and describe what you did in your issue.

### Warning: if you are not using a release, use a release.

## Usage:

Defaults to the latest version of Proton.
```
proton-call -r foo.exe
```

Defaults to the latest version of Proton, all extra arguments passed to the executable.
```
proton-call -r foo.exe --goes --to program
```

`--goes --to program` are passed to the proton / the program

Uses specified version of Proton, any extra arguments will be passed to the executable.
```
proton-call -p 5.13 -r foo.exe
```

Uses custom version of Proton, give the path to directory, not the Proton executable itself.
```
proton-call -c '/path/to/Proton version' -r foo.exe
```

## Config:
Configuration files are extremely simple: `~/.config/proton.conf`
Set your own path to `data` (any empty directory), `steam`, (the directory steam is installed in), and optionally `common` (steam's common directory).
```
data = "/home/avery/Documents/Proton/env/"
steam = "/home/avery/.steam/steam/"

# optional
common = "/home/avery/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/"
```

## Runtime:

Proton Caller 3.1.0 added support for Steam's runtimes and their options. Selecting a runtime can be done by using `-R Soldier/Sniper/Default/BattleEye`

On Proton versions 5 and newer, runtime Soldier is selected automatically

The runtime options can be selected using *multiple* `-o`

available options:
```
    log, // PROTON_LOG
    wined3d, // PROTON_USE_WINED3D
    nod3d11, // PROTON_NO_D3D11
    nod3d10, // PROTON_NO_D3D10
    noesync, // PROTON_NO_ESYNC
    nofsync, // PROTON_NO_FSYNC
    enablenvapi, // PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI
}
```

More about these options can be found in Proton's manual.
